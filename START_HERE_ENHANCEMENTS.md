4. Check **keyboard navigation** (Tab through elements)
5. Monitor **console** for any warnings

### Common Questions:

**Q: Will this slow down my site?**

A: CSS loads once and caches. Performance impact is negligible.

**Q: Can I customize the colors/effects?**
A: Yes! All variables are in the CSS file, easy to modify.

**Q: Will this work on old browsers?**
A: Yes! Graceful degradation means it works everywhere.

**Q: Can I disable specific enhancements?**
A: Yes! Comment out sections in design-enhancements.css.
